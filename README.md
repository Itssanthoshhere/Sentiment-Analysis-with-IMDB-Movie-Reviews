# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis with IMDB Movie Reviews 🎥

## 🌟 Overview

Dive into the world of sentiment analysis with this exciting project! We analyze IMDB movie reviews to determine the sentiment behind them using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. From data preprocessing and text cleaning to feature extraction and model training, we explore it all with Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

Explore the powerful libraries that drive this project:

- **Pandas:** For seamless data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy:** For efficient numerical operations
- **Matplotlib:** To visualize data in style
- **Scikit-Learn:** To implement and evaluate machine learning models
- **NLTK:** For mastering natural language processing
- **Regular Expressions (re):** To clean and refine text data

## 📊 Dataset

We’re working with the [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows/data) – a treasure trove of movie reviews! The dataset file, `IMDB Dataset.csv`, includes:
- **`review`:** The actual movie review text
- **`sentiment`:** The sentiment label (`positive` or `negative`)

## 📝 Steps

Here’s how we bring this project to life:

1. **Import Libraries:** Get the essential tools ready for data processing, visualization, and machine learning.
2. **Load and Inspect Data:** Peek into the dataset, check for any missing values, and understand the data distribution.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Transform text to lowercase, clean out HTML tags, tokenize reviews, and perform lemmatization.
4. **Data Preparation:** Split the data into training and testing sets, encode labels, and convert text into TF-IDF features.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train and test Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine models, then evaluate their performance with accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## ✨ Features

Our project shines with the following features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize text, strip HTML tags, and normalize text.
- **Feature Extraction:** Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Model Training:** Build and train Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance with accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and detailed classification reports.

## 📈 Results

See how well our models perform! We evaluate them based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports to gauge their sentiment classification prowess.
